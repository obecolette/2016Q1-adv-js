Create an example of inheritance, showing at least 2 of the patterns we learned (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Inheritance_and_the_prototype_chain).

For example, you could have ManEatingPlant inherit from Plant. ManEatingPlant could consume sunlight and water, but also Mario (or Wario / Luigi / Toadstool / Princess? ) and eat them for 10 seconds, perhaps reducing the humanoid's life value by some number.

This assignment should be complete with tests that show the child object inherited the parent's methods or properties.

Preferably a Github Repo link (submitted here, or directly to me on Slack) or a .zip submission will work.
